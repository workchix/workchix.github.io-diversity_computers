I started this business in 1995 as an IT and Help Desk service, helping people navigate early technology.
Over the years, it evolved to meet changing needs — in 2016, shifting to support writers adapting to digital tools and submission formats.
In 2020, I reworked the site again to focus on my technical writing background and experience.
